This is my first English blog. Sorry for my Chinglish.

I will talk some technology about my programming work. perhaps others. I am too lazy to create a better blog, like use Jekyll or others. The README.md is good enough for me.

That is all.

I am sorry that the README.md seems not good enough. So I use Jekyll now, but Ruby is not good, I don't like it.

### Updated: 2018-04-15

I am glad to announce that this blog have been migrated to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Goodbye Jekyll, goodbye Ruby.
